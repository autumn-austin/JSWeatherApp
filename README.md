Hello! Welcome to my Javascript weather app!

This is a simple project that utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javscript.

This project alongside several others are to grow my skills as a developer and satisfy the requirements for Code Louisvilles Web Development II course. 

To utilize this small program:

You may open this program by right clicking the index.html file and opening with the live server. 

After you open this project with the live sever, you are free to search the city you wish to view the weather in.

This is a simply project with not much functionality other than it's main purpose. 

Happy coding!
